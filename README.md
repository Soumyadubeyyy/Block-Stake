## 🚀 ERC20 Tokens


### 🔐 Stake Token

The Stake Token is the ERC20 token used for staking within the DApp. Users need to approve this token for the staking contract before staking.

### 🎁 Reward Token

The Reward Token is another ERC20 token generated by the staking process per second. Users earn these tokens as rewards for staking their stake tokens.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ Staking Tokens

- **Authorize Stake Tokens**: Users must authorize a specific amount of stake tokens for staking within the DApp by interacting with the staking smart contract.

### 💰 Reward Generation

- **Create Reward Tokens**: When stake tokens are staked, the smart contract produces reward tokens every second based on the staked amount.

### 📈 Reward Accumulation

- **Earn Rewards Over Time**: Users earn reward tokens over time as their stake tokens remain staked within the DApp.

### 🏆 Claiming Rewards

- **Retrieve Accumulated Rewards**: Users can claim their earned rewards by interacting with the smart contract through the `getReward()` function.

### 🔓 Unstaking Tokens

- **Withdraw Stake Tokens**: Users can unstake their tokens after a specific period or at any time, retrieving their staked tokens along with the accumulated rewards by using the appropriate function in the DApp.
